h3. About

I'm implementing "RFC 1459":https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1459 / "RFC 2812":https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2812 for "Node.js":http://nodejs.org/.

The server will allow clients to connect, join channels, change topics; basic stuff.

Done:

* PASS (connection password)
* PING/PONG
* PRIVMSG
* NOTICE
* MODE
* JOIN
* TOPIC
* NAMES
* LIST
* INVITE
* WHOWAS
* TIME
* VERSION
* AWAY
* WHO
* OPER
* KICK
* WALLOP
* CONNECT
* Connection garbage like MOTD
* Basic data validation
* Simple JSON config file
* Channel modes: o, p, s, t, n, m, i, l, b, v, k
* User modes: i, w, o

Planned:

* Services
* Bring back server links
* Server-to-server NICK messages when nicks are changed or new clients join
* Server-to-server messages for JOIN, NJOIN, MODE, PRIVSG and NOTICE
* SQUIT and QUIT for links
* Server to server communication
* More basic commands: LINKS, TRACE, ADMIN, INFO
* Log files and logging options
* Local ops (+O)
* Stats command
